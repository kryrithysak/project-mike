        This mind-opening book is based on research. Research that attempts at
        answering the time-honored question, if you're smart, why aren't you
        happy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Raj analyzed his old MBA classmates' lives fifteen years after their
        graduation to find out whether their academic success translated to
        career success. The results showed pretty little correlation between the
        two.
      </p>
      <p>
        He went further to investigate whether career success led to “life
        success” or happiness. He discovered the relationship here was even more
        dismal. Hence begging the question, “Why are men so successful in
        business yet not happy?”
      </p>
      <p>
        People generally presume that intelligent people are capable of making
        better decisions in life. Decisions that should lead to a happier life.
        But the reality, according to Raj's findings, was proving otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        He delves into seven common tendencies that successful people need to be
        wary of and proposes seven alternative habits they need to embrace.
      </p>
      <p>
        The author concludes that generosity and appreciating uncertainty can go
        a long way in boosting your happiness. He also asserts that success
        rarely determines one's level of happiness.

      <p>Old habits die hard. But not so hard for James Clear.</p>
      <p>
        In Atomic Habits, he draws a clear roadmap to breaking free from old
        habits and establishing a successful routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        A proven expert in habit development, Clear employs scientific reality
        sprinkled with a generous amount of humor to help you understand how to
        break free from old habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        He provides practical tips for breaking free from a toxic habit and how
        to adopt a more desirable habit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Embracing a new mindset towards the habit you intend to obliterate from
        your life is crucial. Whether it's the need to adopt a new diet, fitness
        routine, or to quit drinking or smoking, he proposes a better way at
        attaining a breakthrough.
      </p>
      <p>His approach is both practical and persuasive.</p>
      <p>
        It's not that your goals are unattainable, or that you're incapable of
        reaching your desired peak performance. It's the system you're using to
        reach them that needs fixing.
      </p>
      <p>
        James Clear makes a compelling case for his strategy using an assortment
        of case studies from accomplished olympian sportsmen, global business
        magnates, successful comedians, and world-class physicians.

      <p>
        Dale Carnegie's masterpiece How to Win Friends & Influence People has
        sold over 45 million copies since it was published in 1936. There must
        be a compelling case for the text to remain so popular ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carnegie's main point is to be good to people and you'll be likable and
        have influence over them. Sounds rather pedestrian. Doesn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
        He goes ahead to demonstrate how that actually works. That's where the
        rubber meets the road. In this text that concentrates classical wisdom,
        Dale unlocks principles for creating influence and impact that seem
        hidden in plain sight. He encourages people not to criticize, condemn,
        or complain in order to be likable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dale furnishes you with 6 rules that will make people like you and 12
        tips on making people follow your way of thinking. He then suggests 9
        ways to influence people to do what you want them to do willingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        By changing your habits, happier life at home, in the office, managing a
        team, in business, or politics is within reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warren Buffet is one of the beneficiaries of Dale's wisdom which he
        credits for success in his life and business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dale's admonitions were brewed in the pot of real-life experience as a
        successful businessman. He was a proficient speaker and a prolific
        salesman.
      </p>
      <p>
        This book is one of the greatest bestsellers of all time; a must-read.

        A masterpiece on how to dispel negative thinking and create room in your
        mind for positive vibes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This book is best suited for those whose lives are typified by endless
        worrying. Scott and Barrie draw their reasoning from a scientific
        backdrop to conclude that your anxieties are offsprings of a cluttered
        mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The authors prescribe practical steps you can take to declutter your
        mind. You begin by focussing on those aspects of your life that deserve
        your attention; set your priorities right. You proceed to declutter your
        mind by waving off your mind those thoughts that do not warrant your
        concern.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason you're bogged down in thought, worry, and stress is because
        the mind is cluttered with unnecessary items that need to be hurled over
        to the trash bag. By learning to apply these principles, you free up
        “free” space in your mind for inner peace. With such a mindset you can
        stay calm and make better decisions in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        An essential resource to teach you how to eliminate the unnecessary
        mental load of worry and anxiety...together with its accompanying
        emotional consequences.

      <div>
        <p>
          “Beyond Mars and Venus” is John Gray's follow-up book to his 1992
          classical book on relationships, “Men are from Mars, Women are from
          Venus”. The book stands out as one of the best self improvement books
          ever written on relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the mainstay of the book is romantic relationships, the
          understanding of how women and men uniquely communicate has found
          application in formal business communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, relationships have evolved. The traditional definitions of
          men and women in relationships have undergone certain levels of
          change. This book by John Gray attempts to make updates on these
          changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Women are learning to optimize their masculine capabilities while men
          are also learning to tap into their feminine potential. These
          complexes bring with them fresh challenges as partners in a romantic
          relationship are no just seeking a “role mate” but a “soul mate”.
        </p>
        <p>
          A man will learn the art of being better at romance while being more
          thoughtful and dependable to his partner.
